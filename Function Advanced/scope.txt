..................SCOPE

Variable "visibility"
........ The location where a variable is defined dictates 
[where we have access to that variable]

.....the idea depending if where you defined a variable, other pieces of 
your code may or may not have access to that value.

.....in the variable scope is that window its the portion of your code
where other values have access to it, or other functions or other pieces 
of the code can access and manipulate that value

.......so there's multiple pieces, different ways that scope behaves in javascript
